                <p>Hayden Quotes is a project I started working on at the beginning of the year. It uses a JavaScript array to pick a quote at random and display it on the screen.</p>

                <br>
                <P>I also started working on a fork of the project called Hayden Quotes 2.0. It builds on the original by replacing the JavaScript array with a database, allowing users to add their own quotes by pushing them to the database.</P>
